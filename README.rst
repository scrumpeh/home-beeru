Basic equipment
---------------
- Brew pot with capacity for 7.6L (2 gallons) of water
- Kitchen strainer
- Thermometer
- Large funnel
- Rolling pin
- 9.5L (2.5 gallons) of water
- Fermentation bottle (potentially the bottle that contains the 3 gallons of water) with the 9.5L (2.5 gallon) level, marked
- Food grade plastic bucket of at least 11.4L (3 gallons)
- 1 metre (3 feet) of 1cm (3/8in) clear poly-vinyl tubing
- Air lock that's positioned in a 9.5mm hole in a water bottle cap

Pale ale ingredients
--------------------
- 1.4kg (3 lb) of dried malt extract
- 0.22g (8 oz) of crushed crystal malt
- 28g (1 oz) of hops
- 1 packet of brewer's yeast
- 3/8 cup (1/4 cup plus 2tbs) of corn sugar

Basic steps
-----------
*based on http://www.instructables.com/id/Make-Beer/?ALLSTEPS*

1. Crush the crystal malt in a freezer bag using the rolling pin. It should become a coarse texture of broken grains.
2. Pour 9.5L (2.5 gallons) of water into the brew pot, leaving at least 7.5cm (3 inches) space at the top. Add the crushed grains. Turn on the heat to medium-high and bring the temperature up to 65-68 degrees. Turn off the heat and cover the brew pot for 30min. Use a strainer to remove as much of the spent grain as possible.
3. Bring the brew pot to a boil. Remove from the heat and stir in the malt. Return to heat and bring to boil again - make sure it doesn't boil over. Once it's a controlled boil, add 2/3 of the hops and maintain the boil for 60min. Submerge the kitchen strainer in the boil for the last 15min to sanitise it for later use. Turn off the heat and add the remaining hops. Cover and let the newly added hops steep for 10min.
4. Cool the wort by partially submerging the brew pot in a sink filled with ice - until the brew pot is cool to the touch and around room temperature.
5. Sanitise the kitchen strainer, fermentation bottle, funnel and tubing by soaking in a solution of 1tbs of bleach per 3.8L (1 gallon) of water.
6. Gently pour the cooled wort through the strainer and funnel into the fermentation bottle so that the total volume is 9.5L (2.5 gallons) - adding any water as required (tap water is ok).
7. Add a half-packet of yeast into the wort (it's better to be a bit over than under). 
8. Leave the bottle to ferment for the next 7 to 10 days in a cool, dark place. 
9. Boil 3/8 cup of sugar in 1 cup water for 5min. Cover and cool a bit. then pour into the bucket. Siphon the beer from the fermentation bottle into the bucket, being careful not to disturb too much sediment at the bottom of the fermentation bottle. The beer is ready for bottling!
10. Bottled beers must be aged for at least 7 days in a cool, dark place (do not put in the fridge).
